    <h2>Grandma's Rustic Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe</h2>
    
    <p>My Grandmother would always make the best chocolate chip cookies.  She would make the dough by scratch over the course of a week. <br>
        This recipe follows her cookies in the old world tradition.  It uses freshly ground wheat berries for flour, and takes about a week to make.
        Please enjoy this recipe.
